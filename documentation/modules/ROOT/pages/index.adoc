== *A Developer's Introduction to OpenShift*

*Welcome to the OpenShift Developer's Introduction training material.* The goal of this online introduction is to get a Developer up to speed on the functionality and nuances of developing applications using the OpenShift platform.

The course is divided into a set of small, easy to consume, self-paced modules that cover varied aspects of the platform. It is aimed at people who have minimal experience, if any, of Kubernetes and Container platforms.

Each Module contains a number of exercises to try, along with detailed explanations of what is being done. 

In order to use the examples you must have a valid login to an OpenShift (4.15+) system and a Project in which to work

The modules are self-paced. Within the description of the Modules there will be Tips and Notes; tips give hints as to what is being done, Notes go into more details about the exercises within the Module.

[TIP]
====
Tips contain useful additional information around the exercises +
They will relate to the flow of the Module
====

[NOTE]
====
Notes will contain in-depth information around the concepts; they are added for interest and detailed knowledge
====

To personalise the Modules add the cluster address and the Project you are using into the text entry boxes at the top of the interface. These are propagated through the
examples so you only need to add them once.


== Workshop setup

Two pieces of information are required to configure the workshop instructions so that the corect OpenShift platform and username are included in the generated commands. This ensures that when you copy commands from the guides, during the workshop exercises, they will work correctly within your specific environment.

Your course facilitators will provide you with :

* Common OpenShift platform URL
* Personal user ID for your use only

Enter the information into the two textboxes at the top of page. Remember to press *RETURN* after entering text into each field.

== Introducing the OpenShift Environment

In this workshop you will use the OpenShift graphical user interface via a browser, and you will also use a command line interface.

=== Web user interface

The OpenShift web user interface is accessible at this URL :

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/
----

Copy the above URL using the button to the right of the text and paste it into a new browser tab. This way you can keep the instructions and the workspace open at the same time.

When you login to OpenShift you are presented with a number of options for how to authenticate. Select the option *htpasswd* as shown below.

Your username has already been selected and is in the format 'userxxx' for example, user003 or user134. All users have the same password which is *openshift*.

Once you are logged in you should see your default project that matches your username. Select this project so that you can begin to create deployments etc.

=== Command line interface

The OpenShift command line utilities that you need for the workshop can be downloaded from the the web user interface of the cluster. However, many users are unable or hesitant to download and install additional software so a command line interface is made available within the web user interface of the cluster. Additionally, there are more command line tools used for the workshop than simply the OpenShift command line. For example, we use curl to interact with applications, and it is easier if these command line utilities are made available quickly and easily.

To access the web based command line interface simply press on the '>_' icon in the top right of the screen as shown below.

This will launch the command line terminal at the bottom of the screen. After a short wait you will see the following text :

[.source]
----
Welcome to the OpenShift Web Terminal. Type "help" for a list of installed CLI tools.
bash-4.4 ~ $
----

To test out the web terminal try out these first couple of commands. Use the button on the right to copy the command and the paste into the command line window.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc whoami
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc projects
----

In the top right corner of the command line window there are three buttons.

* The arrow pointing to top right will launch the command line window in a separate browser tab.
* The horizontal bar will minimize the terminal window, which is useful later when you are doing a web UI based task.
* The cross will close the terminal.

That is all the setup work done - you are now ready to start experimenting in the next chapters.
